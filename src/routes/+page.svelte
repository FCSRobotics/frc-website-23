<p>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Earthquakers, established in the fall of 2022, are
  the&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;robotics team representing Friends'
  Central School. Friends' Central School is a Quaker, community-based school.
  The Quaker values of simplicity, peace, equality, and integrity guide our
  interactions with ourselves and our community.&nbsp;In founding a FIRST
  Robotics team, we incorporate these ideas into FIRSTâ€™s mission of inspiring
  students to pursue careers in science and technology. We hope that by creating
  an accessible, collaborative robotics program, we can develop students with
  the skill sets to affect change in the world around them.
