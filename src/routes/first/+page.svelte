		<p>
			FIRST® is a global robotics organization which prepares students to become
			future leaders in science and technology. The acronym FIRST stands for
			“For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology”. Through
			various competitions including FIRST Lego League, FIRST Tech Challenge,
			and FIRST Robotics Competition, students of all grades K-12 have an
			opportunity to work with skilled adult mentors in a fast-paced,
			collaborative environment trying to solve real world challenges through
			building robots. FIRST’s mission is to inspire innovation and foster
			well-rounded, self-confident student-leaders.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although all FIRST competitions involve building robots, the organization
			is primarily about promoting science and technology amongst students and
			the community at large. FIRST was started by Dean Kamen, an entrepreneur
			and engineer, because he wanted to create a pipeline of future STEM
			leaders through the hands-on challenge of robot building. FIRST teams try
			to live up to this vision by having strong outreach and community service
			programs in addition to building robots. Promoting the joy and excitement
			that science brings is just as important as building the robot itself.

		<p>
			FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a three-month long robotics challenge for high school students.
			This competition is the oldest and most technologically complex FIRST program. Teams 
			spend January and February building and programming a robot that can weigh close to
			150 lbs and be almost as tall as a person. The robot must complete various placement, climbing, or 
			shooting tasks that vary from year to year. During build season, students collaborate with 
			mentors to learn 3D computer design, programming, and machining. The Earthquakers compete 
			in the FIRST Mid-Atlantic District (FMA) and attend two regional competitions per year along
			with the district championship in April if we qualify.
