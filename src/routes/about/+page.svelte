      <p>
          The Earthquaker’s integrate FIRST’s mission of building future
          leaders in science and technology with Friends’ Central School’s mission to
          create students who “aim higher” and “go further”. Guided by our school's
        Quaker values of peace, equality, integrity, and community, we strive to create a
          collaborative environment where all students voices, no matter their
          background, are represented in our robotics community. The Earthquakers 
          create confident, knowledgeable, and compassionate young adults, who are
          commited to giving back to the community around them through science.

		<h1 id = "title" > About the Audrie Garham Ulmer '37 Center for Innovation & Design'</h1>
		<p>
			Envisioned by our current head of school Beth Johnson, Audrie Gardham Ulmer
			'37 Center for Innovation and Design (CID) is an exciting architectural project that 
			transformed the Rex Gymnasium on Friends’ Central School’s upper campus into
			a state-of-the-art engineering design center. The first phase of the CID began in the
			fall of 2022 and the final construction of the CID was completed at the
			the start of the 2024-25 school year. The Earthquakers were created by a
			group of enthusiastic students and mentors as part of the school's vision to promote 
			design thinking, the teaching of advanced technology, and
			integration of project-based learning into the Friends’ Central curriculum so that they
			can remain a leader in 21st century education.
